# Project1

For the project #1 I've used a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com. The original CSV file includes 14 columns and 1,025 rows of data.

The goal of the project is to analyze population of patients enrolled for the study of Cardiovascular deseases, evaluating influence of major factors like Cholesterol, age, etc.

Major columns, that have been used in the Project analysis, are listed out below:

Age: Age of patients
Sex: Sex of petients where 1 = male, 0 = female
cp: Types of chest pain experienced by patients where 0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic
trestbps: Resting blood pressure of patients (in mm Hg)
chol: Cholesterol level of patients in mg/dl
thalach: MAX heart rate of patients
exang: Angina caused by exercise, where 1 = yes and 0 = no
target: Patients with heart desease (0 = yes) and without (1 = no)

Action Steps:

1. Upload CSV data source and create a DataFrame;
2. Transform data into the view that further will be used for the analysis;
3. Find out average of major metrics 
4. Plot gender population of patients with Heart desease conditions
5. Create a box plot of patients with reference to their Cholesterol level
6. Create a scatter plot of patients population age correlated to the cholesterol level
7. Plot bar charts of patients with angina caused by excercise or not
8. Plot chart of patients by chest pain types with heart desease conditions and with non-exercise induced angina

Create a slide deck with summary and major findings, draw a conclusion.
